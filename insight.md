 Key Business Insights – Amazon Sales Analysis

3️⃣ Average Order Value Patterns

The average order value remains consistent across most orders, indicating stable purchasing behavior. Opportunities exist to increase order value through product bundling, cross-selling, or personalized recommendations.

4️⃣ Impact of Discounts on Sales

Discounted orders generate a substantial portion of total revenue, showing that customers are price-sensitive. Strategic use of discounts can help boost sales volume without heavily impacting overall revenue when applied selectively.
